# TVTime

TVTime is a plugin that points to your desired on demand TV provider and compiles all videos into an easy-to-watch format through Kodi

I do not condone piracy, and neither I nor this tweak host any content found while using it. It is simply a web video scraper.

## Installation Instructions

1. Add https://iCH3F.github.io/Kodi/ as a source in Kodi
2. Search for and install TVTime
3. Enjoy!
